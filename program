first of all the tree must work in local, then with the server.


things to do:
- manage how to write all the database fields
- manage how to threat mutual exclusion in the server.
- manage the data retrieve fake
- manage the change of sectors
- manage the deletion because i cannot have pointers to parent. (but I can put them only temporarely)
- manage the pointer to the right leaf, because I cannot have this pointer.
- put the set of nodes in header_cli.h
- manage the correctness of sector retrieved

print node
print record
serialize node
serialize record
deserialize node
deserialize record
...

one function per time
each function must work
no link between leafs
first of all I have to create the tree and make it as I want.
I will see other things later.

header_cli.h
missing the set of nodes for changin them when write list.
done for all the other things

cli.cpp 
almost done
